# ExcelPortfolioProject
In this project, I use Excel to transform fictitious coffee sales data into a interactive dashboard using pivot tables and pivot charts.I started by going through the data, cleaning and analyzing it by removing duplicates, adding columns to better format the data for a pivot tables and finally using different formulas to fill in the empty columns.
Some of the formulas and functions I used include XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, Multiplication Formula for sales and Multiple IF functions.
